# about

Hey! I'm Ben. I study computer science at UT Austin. I'm a member of the [Turing Scholars Honors Program][turing] and my
current coursework includes algorithms and artificial intelligence. Some of my hobbies include reading, video games, and
playing the violin. Details about my employment and projects I've worked on can be found below.

# experience

This summer, I'll be participating in a software engineering internship at [WP Engine][wpengine].

I currently work part time at [ASAA Consulting, Inc.][asaa] My past work there has included writing and testing code
that interacts with Amazon Web Services and data stored in S3.

At [Parasol Laboratory][parasol], I researched the applications of robotic motion planning to modeling protein-ligand
binding. This was also my first job and introduced me to many development tools and practices I still use today. More
details about this project, including a report and poster, are [here][parasol2].

# projects

In my spare time, I love solving algorithm problems. It gives me an opportunity to practice my skills and to learn new
programming languages. Solutions to problems I've solved online can be found [here][solutions].

Game design is one of my hobbies. Several projects during and after high school have allowed me to learn Unity and agile
development principles. [Pest Control][pestcontrol] is a project I worked on for a statewide contest. I oversaw a small
team and helped implement game mechanics.

# interests

Teaching is a passion of mine. It's very rewarding to see others grow and learn. I'm currently enrolled in the
[UTeach][uteach] program, which allows me to get field experience in local grade schools and work toward a teaching
certification alongside my normal degree. I'm thinking about teaching later in my career, and this program is a great
way to get started.
