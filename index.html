    Hi! My name is Ben. I'm currently studying computer science at the University
    of Texas at Austin, where I'm a member of the Turing Scholars Honors Program.
    My current courses are in operating systems, quantum computing, and networking.
    Programming has given me amazing opportunities to build projects, meet new
    people, and learn new skills, and I'm always looking for new chances to
    learn and have fun!
  </p>
  <h1>experience</h1>
  <p>
    At <a href="{{ site.parasol }}">Parasol Laboratory</a>, I worked with
    robotic motion planning as it applies to modeling ligand-protein binding.
    I learned several languages (C++, LaTeX) and tools (Vim, Git, gdb, shell)
    that I still use daily, and participated in structured code review.
    Details and a report can be found <a href="{{ site.parasol_user }}">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h1>projects and interests</h1>
  <p>
    I love to solve problems and participate in programming contests and
    hackathons in my spare time. This is also a great opportunity to learn new
    languages; I'm currently using C++ and Python for many of the problems I
    come across. I maintain a repository of solutions to problems I've solved
    <a href="{{ site.github }}/online-judge">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Game design is one of my hobbies. Several team projects during and following
    high school have given me the opportunity to learn Unity and agile development
    principles. <a href="{{ site.github }}/pestcontrol">Pest Control</a> is a
    project I worked on for a statewide game design contest that allowed me to
    oversee a small team and to help build a level of a game with unique mechanics.
  </p>
  <h1>contact</h1>
  <p>
    I'm looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2019. If you want to get
    in touch, feel free to email me at <a href="{{ site.email_action }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
    Your can find my LinkedIn profile <a href="{{ site.linkedin }}">here</a> and a
    copy of my resume <a href="resume/resume.pdf">here</a>.
