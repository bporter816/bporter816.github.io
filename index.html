    Hi! My name is Ben. I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, where I'm a member
    of the Turing Scholars Honors Program. I'm currently exploring operating systems and wireless networking.
    Programming has given me amazing opportunities to build projects, meet new people, and learn new skills, and I'm
    always looking for new chances to learn and have fun!
  </p>

  <p>
    This summer, I'll be participating in a software engineering internship at
    <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work part time at <a href="http://www.asaaconsulting.com">ASAA Consulting, Inc.</a>. In the past, I
    worked on a project using C# to interact with the Amazon Web Services API and data stored in Amazon S3 buckets. The
    project introduced me to some new testing methodologies, like mocking and reflection.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <a href="{{ site.parasol }}">Parasol Laboratory</a>, I worked with robotic motion planning as it applies to
    modeling ligand-protein binding. I learned several languages (C++, LaTeX) and tools (Vim, Git, gdb, shell) that I
    still use daily, and participated in structured code review. Details and a report can be found
    <a href="{{ site.parasol_user }}">here</a>.

    I love to solve problems and participate in programming contests and hackathons in my spare time. This is also a
    great opportunity to learn new languages; I'm currently using C++ and Python for many of the problems I come across.
    I maintain a repository of solutions to problems I've solved <a href="{{ site.github }}/online-judge">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Game design is one of my hobbies. Several team projects during and following high school have given me the
    opportunity to learn Unity and agile development principles.
    <a href="{{ site.github }}/pestcontrol">Pest Control</a> is a project I worked on for a statewide game design
    contest that allowed me to oversee a small team and to help build a level of a game with unique mechanics.

    Teaching and tutoring is a passion of mine. It's very rewarding to pass on knowledge to others and to see the
    amazing things they go on to do with that knowledge. This semester, I'm getting started with UT's
    <a href="https://uteach.utexas.edu">UTeach</a> program. I'm thinking about teaching later in my career, and this
    program is a great way to get classroom experience alongside my regular degree plan.
